# Model Training

Required dependencies:
```bash
pip install scipy
pip install opencv-python
pip install torch
pip install matplotlib
pip install datasets
pip install transformers
pip install tqdm
```
We have trained the model on ParamHimalaya, I have provided the ``run.py`` and ``main.sh`` file. To run the model training on local or google Colab => path to datasets (images and masks) and folder to save the model (./models) have to be appropriately set.
